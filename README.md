# Project Overview
With the rapid growth of the EdTech industry, accurately predicting sales trends is crucial to meeting demand and strategizing future offerings. This project explores historical sales data and applies advanced time series forecasting methods to provide actionable insights.<br>

**Key Objectives:<br>**
Analyze historical sales data to understand trends, seasonality, and patterns.<br>
Develop a predictive model to forecast future course sales.<br>
Present insights and visualizations that support strategic planning.<br>

**Tools & Techniques<br>**
The following tools and methodologies were used in the project:<br>

Programming: Python<br>
Libraries: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels, scikit-learn<br>
Forecasting Models: ARIMA and SARIMA<br>
Evaluation Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² Score<br>

**Process<br>**
1. Data Preparation<br>
Cleaned and preprocessed historical sales data from EdTech courses.<br>
Resampled data to a monthly granularity for a clearer trend analysis.<br>

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)<br>
Identified seasonality, trends, and anomalies in sales patterns.<br>
Visualized data using line plots and decomposition graphs.<br>

3. Model Development<br>
Built and fine-tuned ARIMA, SARIMA models for forecasting.<br>
Compared model performance and selected the best-performing model for predictions.<br>

4. Forecasting & Insights<br>
Forecasted future sales for a 12-month horizon.<br>
